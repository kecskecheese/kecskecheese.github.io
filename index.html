    <h1>Welcome to my shitty site</h1>
    <p>I wonder how you ended up here...</p>
    <p>Honestly I just made this site out of curiosity to see if I can do it and I never thought anyone would visit it.</p>
    <p>Anyways, you probably want to know some things about me.</p>
    <h2>A few things about me</h2>
    <p>I'm nothing special, just another geek interested in linux, programming except I'm also interested in planes and I'm planning to become a pilot.</p>
    <p>Some of my friends say that I'm good in everything, a jack of all trades. </p>
    <p>Even though I don't have any social media appearance, so you know nothing about me, I will keep from revealing my true age, but I'll tell you that I'm in my late teens. </p>
    <p>I was born in Budapest, Hungary and been living there since</p>
    <h2>What I do in my free time</h2>
    <p><i>The little free time I have...</i></p>
    <p>I'm usually just playing games, mostly fps, but I'm trying to open up to different kind of games.</p>
    <p>I like "ricing" my linux desktop, my current setup is <a href="https://github.com/kecskecheese/dotfiles">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Also all of my code is on my <a href="https://github.com/kecskecheese">github</a> (I literally just steal others code and rewrite it a little)</p>
    <h2>Some other things I made</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A homepage to use in your browser (<a href="https://kecskecheese.github.io/homepage">page</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kecskecheese/homepage">source</a>)</li>
        <li>A <a href="https://kecskecheese.github.io/rickroll">rickroll</a> meme site, it's origins date back to 2019, when one of my friends told me I can't make a porn website, so I proved him wrong by rickrolling him, it's cursed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed reading about me</p>
