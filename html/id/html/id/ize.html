                <h2>A Few Facts About Me</h2>
                <p style="color:#5f87af">Just to paint you a little picture of who I am</p>
                <p>I entered this world over 40 years ago ( I will try to keep from 
                revealing my true age). I am married and have 4 kids, 4 cats, and a dog.</p>
                <p>
                    I spent the majority of my life living in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) about 50 miles 
                    from the base of Mt. Rainier in Washington State. If you have never been, I recommend
                    you go at least once, just to visit, it is gorgeous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My family and I moved away from the PNW in 2017 and landed in Northwest Arkansas (NWA),
                    long story, not the first place we would have chosen to live.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been an automotive technician for the past 
                    25 years and reached the level of Master Diagnostic 
                    Technician (MDT) for Toyota. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm interested in people; who they are and how they think.
                    I'm interested in computers, languages, computer languages
                    and a few other things, too.

                    <summary>Wait, What?! You're joking, right?<br>
                                Of course I am...<span style="color:#ff000">or am I</span></summary>

                    <p>You are a great friend to those who know you. You put others above yourself.</p>
                    <p><span id="about-you-os">Online privacy is overrated, keep using that Windows PC and relax, It's just you, me, and Bill Gates here now.</span></p>
                    <p>You are thinking to yourself, he can't know I am in 
                        <span id="about-you-country">Hungary</span>. <span style="color:#5f87af">Or can he</span>?
                    </p>
                    <p>All this time you thought that 
                        <span id="about-you-browser">Firefox</span> was secure, but now you are
                        second guessing that and think... can Jake actually see me?
                    </p>
                    <p>Let me put your mind at ease. I'm not watching you and I am just guessing
                        when I say you are in <span id="about-you-city">Budapest</span>.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for visiting, I hope you enjoyed learning a little about me. You're
                        great.</p>
