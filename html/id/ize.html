                        Of course I am...<span style="color:#ff000">or am I</span></summary>

                    <p>Let me put your mind at ease. I'm not watching you and I am just guessing
                        when I say you are in <span id="about-you-city">Budapest</span>.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for visiting, I hope you enjoyed learning a little about me. You're
                        great.</p>
