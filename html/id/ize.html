                    <summary>Wait, What?! You're joking, right?<br>
                                Of course I am...<span style="color:#ff000">or am I</span></summary>

                    <p>You are a great friend to those who know you. You put others above yourself.</p>
                    <p><span id="about-you-os">Online privacy is overrated, keep using that Windows PC and relax, It's just you, me, and Bill Gates here now.</span></p>
                    <p>You are thinking to yourself, he can't know I am in 
                        <span id="about-you-country">Hungary</span>. <span style="color:#5f87af">Or can he</span>?

                    <p>All this time you thought that 
                        <span id="about-you-browser">Firefox</span> was secure, but now you are
                        second guessing that and think... can Jake actually see me?
                    </p>
                    <p>Let me put your mind at ease. I'm not watching you and I am just guessing
                        when I say you are in <span id="about-you-city">Budapest</span>.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for visiting, I hope you enjoyed learning a little about me. You're
                        great.</p>
